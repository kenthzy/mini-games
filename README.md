### This Java Swing program, welcomeScreen, creates an introductory interface for a collection of mini-games. It's a window displaying a logo/image at the top, followed by a "START THE GAME" button. Clicking this button initiates a loading process indicated by a progressing JProgressBar. 
### Once the progress reaches completion, it automatically transitions to the main menu (mainMenuPage) containing various game options. The code uses Swing components like JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, and JProgressBar to create this user interface. Overall, it provides a simple and visually engaging entry point for users to start exploring and playing the available mini-games.

### This is a Main Menu for a suite of mini-games within a single application. It builds a main menu page (mainMenuPage) using Swing components such as JFrame, JPanel, and JLabel, showcasing a variety of game options as buttons. Each button, upon being clicked, initiates an action event via the implemented ActionListener. 
### Depending on the user’s choice, it creates and shows different game windows, including Snake, Tic-Tac-Toe, Ping-Pong, Tetris, Minesweeper, and Brick-Breaker. It also incorporates event handling for keyboard inputs in certain games and provides an exit confirmation dialog when the “Exit” button is chosen. In essence, this code arranges and controls a menu-based interface for users to navigate and enjoy various mini-games.

### Snake is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food pellets.

### Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking either an "X" or an "O" in empty squares, aiming to create a row, column, or diagonal of their symbol.

### Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where players manipulate falling blocks, each composed of four square pieces. The goal is to create complete horizontal lines without any gaps.
